# Hippocampal_Stimulation_and_FA
Diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and resting-state data were collected from 35 participants, and memory data were collected from 23 of these participants. rTMS was delivered to the IPC location maximally connected to the hippocampus in 24 participants. Eleven participants received vertex stimulation. DWI images were collected prior to stimulation. Resting-state and memory were collected prior to, one day after, and one week after, 3-4 consecutive daily sessions of stimulation.
